#2.2.1 We want to know if the coefficient on the growth fund price movements is statistically 
#significant. State your hypotheses.
#My work is in the document

#2.2.2 Perform a single parameter test (t test) for the importance of growth fund price movements 
#in your model and interpret the result.



#2.2.3 Perform a joint test of the growth fund and value fund price movements in explaining the 
#price movements in the FSELX fund: state your hypotheses, perform the test using both F statistic 
#and Chi-squared distribution, and interpret the result.
