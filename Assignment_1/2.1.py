#2.1.1 Write the regression model.


#2.1.2 Run the regression, report the estimated coefficients (parameters) for intercept (using alpha 
#notation) and slopes (using beta notation), along with their corresponding standard errors.


#2.1.3 Using the reported coefficients for the intercept and the slope, write your SRF (sample 
#regression function), and plot the OLS residuals.


#2.1.4 Interpret what the value for your intercept, and the other two coefficients mean in your 
#model.



#2.1.5 2.1.5 If in a given day the growth fund price was $95 and the value fund was $100, what would be 
#the price on the FSELX fund?
